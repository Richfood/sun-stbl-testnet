# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
cp copy.env .env

```

if you want to deploy on testnet/mainnet:

```shell
yarn clean
yarn prettier
yarn format
yarn compile
yarn deploy:testnet or yarn deploy:mainnet
```
